# CSIntel
CrowdStrike Threat Intelligence 


This file will act as a Python API for CrowdStrike's Threat Intelligence API. It was built to make it
easy to use the Intel API. 

This module can be used one of two ways: by executing it directly from the command line or by importing 
it into another script. 

Example 1: 
    
    $> ./CSIntel.py --custid ABC --custkey DEF --day --indicators

Example 2:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import CSIntel
    api_obj = CSIntel.CSIntelAPI(custid, custkey)
    results = api_obj.SearchLastWeek()

To learn more about the functions you can use when importing this file see the included python documentation:


    $> pydoc ./CSIntel.py

You can also see the examples included within for the simple functions that are used to enable
the CLI commands.

## Using from the Command Line
-------

The first step to using this from the Command Line is to make sure you're passing your Customer ID
and your Customer Key. There are two ways you can do this:

1. Pass your Customer ID and Key from the command line:
        `$> ./CSintel.py --custid <Customer ID> --custkey <Customer Key>`
2. Place your Customer ID and Key in a config file to be read by the script. By default the file
    expected is ~/.csintel.ini

In order to create this config file you can either write it explicitly or save the config from the
    command line executation. 
        `$> ./CSintel.py --custid ABCD --custkey EFGH --write`

This will save Customer ID & Key to the default config file (~/.csintel.ini). If you wish to specify
    a different file you can pass that: `--write --config diffFile.ini`

If you want to manually write the config file it follows this layout:

        [CrowdStrikeIntelAPI]
        custid = ABCD
        custkey = EFGH

Once you are setup to pass your Customer ID and Key you can start searching the Threat Intel API. 


##Search

### Actor(s)
* --actor

Query a specific actor.

The named Actor the indicator is associated with (e.g. Panda, Bear, Spider, etc). The actor list is also represented under the labels list in the JSON data structure.

    --actor rocketkitten

* --actors

Query a pattern and return all actors that match it.

    --actors kitten

###IP
* --ip

Search for an IP address.

This is performed as an indicator search where type specifies IP address. 

###Domain
* --domain

Search for a domain.

This is performed as an indicator search where type specifies domain.

###Report
* --report

Search for a report name and get the indicators associated with it.

The report ID the indicator is associated with (e.g. CSIT-XXXX, CSIR-XXXX, etc). The report list is also represented under the labels list in the JSON data structure.

###Indicator
* --indicator

Possible indicator types, from the following set:

* binary\_string 
* compile\_time 
* device\_name 
* domain
* email\_address 
* email\_subject 
* event\_name 
* file\_mapping 
* file\_name 
* file\_path 
* hash\_ion 
* hash\_md5 
* hash\_sha1 
* hash\_sha256 
* ip\_address

* persona\_name 
* phone\_number 
* port
* registry 
* semaphore\_name 
* service\_name
* url

###Label
* --label

The Intel API contains additional context around an indicator under the labels list. Some of these labels, such as 'malicious\_confidence' are accessible via the top level data structure. All labels, including their associated timestamps, will be accessible via the labels list.

###Target

For example, a malicious file hash may always have a value of 'high' while domains and IP addresses will very likely change over time. The malicious confidence level is also represented under the labels list in the JSON data structure.

* High - If indicator is an IP or domain, it has been associated with malicious activity within the last 60 days.
* Medium - If indicator is an IP or domain, it has been associated with malicious activity within the last 60-120 days.
* Low - If indicator is an IP or domain, it has been associated with malicious activity exceeding 120 days.
* Unverified - This indicator has not been verified by a Crowdstrike Intelligence analyst or an automated system.

###Kill Chain
* --killchain

The point in the kill chain at which an indicator is associated. The kill chain list is also represented under the labels list in the JSON data structure. The following italicized entries are sub-labels of the parent kill\_chain.

An example Search is: search for “/labels?match=reconnaissance”

* Reconnaissance
This indicator is associated with the research, identification, and selection of targets by a malicious actor.

* Weaponization

* Actionsonobjectives (Actions on Objectives)
This indicator is associated with a malicious actor's desired effects and goals.


###Malware
* --malware

Indicates the malware family an indicator has been associated with. An indicator may be associated with more than one malware family. The malware family list is also represented under the labels list in the JSON data structure.

###Active

Status Type contains information tagged in the below italicized list which is broken down by the current status of the indicator.
An example Search is: “/labels?match=confirmedactive”

This indicator is likely to be currently supporting malicious activity

###Threat
* --threat

Threat Type contains information tagged in the below italicized list which is broken down by the type of threat category that was associated with the indicator.
An example Search is: “/labels?match=clickfraud”

* ClickFraud
This indicator is used by actors engaging in click or ad fraud

This indicator is associated with activity known to target point-of- sale machines such as AlinaPoS or BlackPoS.
 
* Ransomware
This indicator is associated with ransomware malware such as Crytolocker or Cryptowall.
 
* Suspicious
This indicator is not currently associated with a known threat type but should be considered suspicious.
Targeted
This indicator is associated with a known actor suspected to associated with a nation-state such as DEEP PANDA or ENERGETIC BEAR.
 
* TargetedCrimeware
This indicator is associated with a known actor suspected to be engaging in criminal activity such as WICKED SPIDER.

###Domain Type
* --domaintype 

Domain Type contains information tagged in the below italicized list which is broken down by the type of domain category that was identified.
An example Search is: “/labels?match=actorcontrolled”

* ActorControlled
It is believed the malicious actor is still in control of this domain.
 
* DGA
This domain is the result of malware utilizing a domain generation algorithm.

* DynamicDNS
This domain is owned or used by a dynamic DNS service.
 
* DynamicDNS/Afraid
This domain is owned or used by the Afraid.org dynamic DNS service.
 
* DynamicDNS/DYN

* PhishingDomain
This domain has been observed to be part of a phishing campaign.

* StrategicWebCompromise
While similar to the DomainType/LegitimateCompromised label, this label indicates that the activity is of a more targeted nature.

    --out hashes            -print just the hashes
    --out domains           -print just domains
